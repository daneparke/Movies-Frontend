## Galvanize OMDB

This is a full stack application, built in react, that pulls data from a [backend](https://github.com/daneparke/Movies-Backend) that I created.
In this application you can add, edit, or delete movies from the collection of movies. You can also add ratings to the movies.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone this repository and run `npm install`.
